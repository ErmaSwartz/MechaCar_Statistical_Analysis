# identifying stats test typers 
# qualitative test for normality 
# checking for the bellcurve shape

#visualize distribution using density plot
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=wt)) + geom_density() 


# the quantitative test for normality 
# uses a stats test to quantify the probability of whether or not the test data 
# came from a normally distributed data set
?shapiro.test()

#only requires numeric vector of values 
shapiro.test(mtcars$wt)
# if the data is greater than .05, then the data is considered normally distributed
