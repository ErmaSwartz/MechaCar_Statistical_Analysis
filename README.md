## Section One
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
##### From our summary we can see that our P-value is less than our Vehicle Lenght, Vehicle Width, and Ground Clearance. These three variables are providing variance, and we can say they are providing nonrandom variance to the MPG values in the data set. We know this because the P-value is less than .05.
##### The slope of the linerar model is not considered to be Zero, because the p-value is 5.35
##### 71% of the time the model will be good at predicitng the mpg, and 29% of the time it will not be good at this. This is better than a lot of other models, but is in no way a full proof model.

# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
## Section Two
##### The current manufacturing data indicates that lot one and lot two do not exceed 100 pounds and therefore meet this design specification. Lot 3's variance is above 100 and therefore does not live up to the specification.
